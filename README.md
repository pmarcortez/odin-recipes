# odin-recipes
In this project I will create a webpage containing recipes for some Mexican dishes. 
This project will demonstrate my ability to push and commit files to github. 
In addition to this, it will demonstrate my ability to use text-based elements that control the size and emphasize of text, it will also showcase my ability to create ordered and unordered lists. 
Lastly, this project will demonstrate my ability to use relative links and display images on a webpage.
