            <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons vegetable oil <em>(plus more for frying)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To Serving</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cotija cheese</li>
            <li>chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>diced white onions</li>
            <li>Mexican crema or sour cream</li>
            <li>fried eggs <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prep the chiles. </b>In a medium pot, add the guajillo chiles, árbol chiles, and enough water to completely cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let the chiles soak for 10 minutes to soften.</li>
            <li><b>Blend the chiles. </b>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the softened chiles to a blender. Add 1 ½ cups fresh water, the tomato, garlic, onion, and salt. Blend until completely smooth. If the sauce is not smooth, strain it through a fine mesh sieve to remove any solids.</li>
            <li><b>Slice the tortillas. </b>Stack the corn tortillas on top of each other and cut them into eighths to create small triangle wedges. Line a large plate with paper towels and set it aside.</li>
            <li><b>Preheat oil. </b>Fill a large sauté pan or deep skillet with about 2 inches of oil and heat over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches at least 350°F. (To test, drop a small piece of tortilla in the oil. If it sizzles, it's ready.)</li>
            <li><b>Fry the sliced tortillas. </b>Working in batches, add half of the tortillas and fry for 8 minutes, stirring every minute or so, until they are crispy. Transfer them to the lined plate to drain and repeat the frying process with the remaining tortilla wedges.</li>
            <li><b>Heat up the salsa. </b>In a separate sauté pan or skillet, heat 1 ½ teaspoons of vegetable oil. Pour in the salsa roja and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li><b>Coat the tortillas. </b>Remove the pan from the heat and add in the fried tortilla chips. Gently toss them together to coat.</li>
            <li><b>Assemble and serve. </b>Serve immediately and garnish with cotija cheese, cilantro, onions, and Mexican crema. Top with a fried egg if desired.</li>
        </ol>
